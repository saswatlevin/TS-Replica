registerUser Test List
DATABASE INSERTION TEST
* Should successfully insert user into database via User.create()

DATA TRANSFORMATION TESTS
* Should generate 12-char user_id via createRandomString(6)
* Should set docType to "USER"
* Should set date_created_at to current ISO8601 timestamp
* Should hash password with argon2 before storage
* Should NOT store plain-text password

All external dependencies are always mocked

registerUser - Database Insertion Test - "should successfully insert user into database via User.create()"
	
	# The hashed_password, user_id and date_time values are mocked	
	
	# argon2 hash function execution is called with mockResolvedValue()
	# createRandomString function is called with mockReturnValue()
	# getCurrentDateTime function is called with mockReturnValue()
	
	# The user_to_be_created object value is mocked
	# The create function is called with mockResolveValue()
	
	# The request body value is mocked
	
	# The response body is created as a JSON function
	
	# The registerUser function is called with the mock request body, the created response body, and the next function 
        # The number of times the create function is called is asserted.
	# What the create function is called with is also asserted.

	# BEFORE EACH TEST THE MOCKS ARE RESET
        
        # The request body is mocked
        # The response body is mocked
        # The next function is mocked
        
        # The user_id is mocked.
        
	# The create_random_string function is called with mockReturnValue('7ycthivdrqvl');
        # The argon2 hash function is called with mockResolvedValue('$argon2id$hash');
        # The currentDateTime function is called with mockReturnValue('2025-05-10T20:00:00Z');
        # The create function is called with mockResolvedValue({ user_id: mockUserId });
	
	# The registerUser function is called with the mock request body, the created response body, the mocked next function
	
	# Expect createRandomString to have been called with (6).
	# expect(User.create).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.objectContaining({ user_id: mockUserId })
