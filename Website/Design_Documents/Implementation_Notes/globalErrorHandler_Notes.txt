// * Receive the error
// * Observe whether the error is an OperationalError or Not
// * If an Error is an OperationalError, then there is no need for a remediation message, otherwise there is.
// * Ensure that non-errors aren't intercepted

For remediation messages, there should be 2 categories: Development and Production.
A database with a collection of error documents, each containing a remediation message for development and production environments.
Also, there should be a separate function to decide the type of the remediation message.
When accessing any attributes of objects, use the optional chaining operator.
