/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@#!\$\. ])[A-Za-z\d@#!\$\. ]+$/

(?= ) -> Positive Lookahead. Tells the system look for "what is as follows"
So, for each character class (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, @,#,!,.,$), we create a positive lookahead.
Then, we create a "character class", [] with each of those same characters.

The lookaheads tell the regex what to allow, (they are only rules, not used to match).
The + or * characters are used for matching the characters.

The () are used to group expressions together while [] is used to match 1 or more types of characters.

* -> •	The preceding element can appear 0, 1, or many times.
        It is optional, but can repeat.

+ -> •  The preceding element can appear 1 or more times.
        It isn't optional.
