In production, as little information as possible should be leaked about the errors. This is for security.
In dev, we want to get as much info as possible.
The global error handling function sends all the info in case of development but only limited info otherwise.
The global error handling function is divided into the devError and prodError functions.

In production, only operational errors should be sent to the client.
In production, programming error and other unknown errors aren't sent to the client.
Eg - Mongoose validation errors aren't going to be sent to the client in production.
