The routes themselves can be wrapped in the async error handler, however, then we would need to remember which routes have async functions.
The findById() in mongoose helps find mongodb documents by id. 
MongoDB accepts any 12-character string as a valid document id. 
This can lead to mongoose returning "success" despite there being no object present.
To Deal with this, we need to create a custom error with a message and a status code, and return next(error).
This will allow this error to be handled by the global error handling middleware.
