1) We create a CustomError class by extending the Error class of JS.
2) A constructor is created. it takes 2 arguments -> A message and status_code.
3) The message is passed to super().
4) The status is set to 'fail (Client Error)' if the status code is from 400 - 499 or to 'error (Server Error)' if the error code is from 500 to 599.
5) An isOperational property is created since this class is meant to handle Operational Errors.
6) The Error class always creates a Stack Trace. To preserve it, we call Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor).
