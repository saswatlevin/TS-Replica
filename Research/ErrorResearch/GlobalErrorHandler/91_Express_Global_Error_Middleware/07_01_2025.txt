What are the 4 or 5 stages where we are checking for errors?
How do we check ? Scalability of that check

Focus on validations before sending request to mongodb
Controller for when we get an error

1) Invalid Route -> Route itself is invalid. How do you make sure that all the invalid routes are captured?
2) Missing Parameters -> If the params are missing, how to identify all required params are available.
3) Invalid Parameters -> Check if all parameters of correct datatype, expected range.
4) Invalid Operations -> If parameters are processed, check their validity after processing.

Use library to check validity of models on server type.
Find libraries to do the 4 steps / validate data.
Make some library do what I am doing inside createUser in terms of validation.

Find standard libraries to do the above 4 steps. 
Separation of logic -> Controller will delegate the above 4 steps to some libraries.

What We Will Do: 
1) Get validation libraries for mongoose.
2) Get validation Libraries for URL (Augment with our needs)
3) Create validation function for file paths.
