Go to the file called registerUserResponseSchema_Tests.md and look under the <SMS COMMS - IFV> category, implement all the tests. 

For tests that accept a valid value, follow the rules: "result.success should assert true", "Value of the field being tested should be asserted from the result", "Length of the result should be asserted (for length tests only)"

For tests that reject a value, follow the rules: "result.success should assert false", "A "code" or "message" of result.errors[0].issues should be asserted", "The corresponding data value being accepted should be a asserted from the testData".
